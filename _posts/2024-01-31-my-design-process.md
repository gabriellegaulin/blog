## My Design Process

### How do you progress a creative project?

I have two main ways of starting a new project, which vary based on the way I get inspired.

When I am reading a book, watching something, or talking to someone and organically get interested in something that comes up in the story, I typically jump into the Wikipedia research hole.  In contrast, when I am planning for something that I think would strategically be good, such as a pattern collection based on a popular trend, etc. I go about everything in a different fashion.

### Organic Inspiration / Personal Projects

I love exploring through reading, YouTube, etc., and I love talking about new things with new people to really get a different perspective. I usually take a moment to note down in my phone, in a notebook, on a scrap paper (which I WILL promptly lose) what triggered my curiosity. Then I will get on Wikipedia or Google at the next socially acceptable moment and start looking things up. Often times, it will end there, which is why my phone browser has graduated from 98 tabs to :) . This causes people who look at my phone huge amounts of stress. One big game changer for me has been using Notion to capture a lot of articles and websites that I’m interested in instead of just leaving them up on my devices for weeks. (I’ll still ignore them there for months, but at least I know they’re saved!)

If the thought is really interesting, I’ll move on to more academic resources, such as articles and public institutions webpages (museums, etc.). Then I begin to “sketch” out my thoughts about the subject, whether that be writing or drawings, sometimes both! I try to think what type of project this “motif” would fit best: a written piece, a pattern design, an illustration, etc. Sometimes it may even be enough to base a whole series or collection on! 

Once I’ve decided the direction of the project, it’s time for : more research! Especially as I am inspired by the cultures and art of the world, I want to tell the stories that go with the motifs I’m exploring. So I will take the time to explore the traditions and context that go with each motif, and I try my best to include that information with my work. Respecting the tradition and context means that sometimes I decide to cancel the project altogether. However, by researching the bigger story of my inspiration, more often I give myself a greater group of motifs, artists, stories, and other inspiring material to work from!

Now it’s time to incorporate the new information into the project. I try my best to include as much relevant information as I can. A lot of times, I think of a project kind of like a research paper. The more you know, the better, but the thesis still needs to shine through! I finalize the ideas and choose how I’m going to present it : for art, what type of software, media, etc. I’m going to use.

After going through revision and prototyping several different versions, I pick one option as the final version. Now it’s time to create the portfolio materials! I was struck by the idea recently that, especially in personal projects, the portfolio materials can be more important that the actual project. They are the materials that future clients and employers review, of course, so I have started focusing on these much more, trying to create interesting layouts that enhance the product and also show my personality. Most importantly, I make sure to share the stories and inspirations behind my work in the portfolio materials. Maybe I can even inspire someone else to dive into the topic!

### Briefs / Professional Inspiration

This path is much closer to a real “design process”, and typically starts with a brief. If the brief is very simple, I typically take the time to fill out the details, such as an imaginary client, a deadline, preferred aesthetic, etc. - without constraints, I can swim around in the possibilities (and save webpages to Notion to ignore) for months. These constraints allow me to make decisions much faster, because I can ask myself the one simple question: Does it fit the client’s demands? 

Much like my personal project, I then start by searching around for something that both interests me and fits the brief. (I’m incapable of dealing with something boring - luckily I can usually find something to draw me in in just about any topic!) After capturing a source of inspiration, I try to make a grab-bag of images, links, stories etc. to present to the client. Sometimes I’ll include some initial sketches as well. 

One great thing about working with a client or partner is that revisions are required and productive. Through discussions, we can narrow down what works for both of us. I try my best to reflect the input in my work. Sometimes, it means taking the project in an entirely different direction than I first imagined! 

After first discussions, I make a prototype or first draft: for a pattern, it might be a rough sketch of the pattern layout with semi-finalized motifs, for an illustration, a colored sketch provides enough for moving into the next round of discussions with the client! 

After two or three rounds, we are usually both satisfied with the work and ready to create final versions. Much like my own personal projects, I have learned to pay extra attention to portfolio materials! 

### My process is pretty chaotic at the beginning, but it always funnels down into a linear process at the end. How do you work? Do you have any tips for making design decisions or finding inspiration?
